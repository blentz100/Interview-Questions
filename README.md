# Interview-Questions
These are some common interview questions I like to use. I usually only ask a small subset of these but I like to be prepared. I'll tailor the list and add a few based on the interview. Pull requests welcome. 

I like the interview to be more conversational in nature, but if it doesn't go
that way I'll fall back on asking more questions.

## Behaviorial Questions

+ Tell me about yourself

  *Your answer to this question should not be a suprise to anyone who has read your resume, cover letter, LinkedIn profile, Github profile or any other publicy available information about you. Assume your interviewer has read all of those things - if you paint a different picture than what's already out there, that's a red flag for the interviewer. Your answer should be a concise summary of what you have done personally and professionaly and how it's relevant to this role. Don't try to sell yourself with a lengthy pitch at this point. This is usually the first question you'll get, and it's your chance to set the tone that you came prepared with a rehearsed answer. If they want you to expand on any particular area they will ask.*

  *"I've worked in the service industry for 5 years and last year I decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp. I've been practicing coding challenges regularly for the last 6 months and I'm working on a personal project that has to do with one of my hobbies - XYZ. I'm passionate about making the transition into front end web development.  I'm a lifelong learner and I'm excited to discuss this opportunity with you today."*

+ How did you find out about this role?

  *Many companies advertise roles in different places and they like to know where you found the role. Be prepared to tell them where you found it. If you don't know the answer it might come across like you are applying to tons of jobs randomly.*
